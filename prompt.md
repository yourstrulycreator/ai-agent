## Build the AI Agent
1. **Set Up Browser Automation**
   - Choose Playwright or Selenium to launch a browser.
   - Write code to log in to LinkedIn.
   - Code user-like actions: scrolling, clicking, and moving the mouse.
   - Insert random delays between actions.
2. **Integrate the AI Model**
   - Connect your local language model to process page content.
   - Use LangChain to link the language model with automation.
   - Let the model decide the next action by reading page content.
3. **Extract Data**
   - Identify the page elements for:
     - First and last names
     - LinkedIn URL
     - Job title
     - Employer
   - Write code to locate these elements and extract their text.
   - Save the data in CSV or JSON format.
4. **Simulate Human Behavior**
   - Implement smooth scrolling.
   - Use libraries (like PyAutoGUI) for realistic mouse movements.
   - Add random delays to mimic human timing.
5. **Test and Debug**
   - Run your agent on sample LinkedIn pages.
   - Check that it mimics human behavior.
   - Confirm that data extraction works as expected.
6. **Refine and Expand**
   - Use the AI model to handle changes in page layouts.
   - Adjust code to work with different LinkedIn page formats.
   - Monitor performance and adjust delays if needed.
## Example Code Snippet
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
import random
import time

def human_delay():
    time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.new_page()
    
    # Navigate to LinkedIn login
    page.goto('https://www.linkedin.com/login')
    # Add your login automation here
    human_delay()
    
    # Navigate to a LinkedIn page (e.g., Stanford's page)
    page.goto('https://www.linkedin.com/school/stanford-university/')
    human_delay()
    
    # Simulate mouse movement
    page.mouse.move(100, 100)
    human_delay()
    
    # Scroll the page to mimic user behavior
    page.mouse.wheel(0, 300)
    human_delay()
    
    # Example extraction of names (update the selector as needed)
    names = page.query_selector_all('css-selector-for-names')
    for name in names:
        print(name.inner_text())
        
    browser.close()
```
